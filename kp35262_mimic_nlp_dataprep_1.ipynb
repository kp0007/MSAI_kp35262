Initial troponin level was greater\\nthan 50 and after the next 72 hours its level was 1.5.\\nNormal is less than .03.  Within the next 24 hours the\\npatient underwent cardiac catheterization.  The patient's\\nright sided pressures, PA was 50/17, right atrial mean was\\n16, pulmonary wedge pressure was 16, left ventricular end\\ndiastolic pressure was 17.  Cardiac output was 6.0, index was\\n3.3, EF was 30% with akinetic anterolateral and apex walls\\nand hypokinetic antero basal wall and normal posterior and\\nbasal wall.  The native vessels showed left main trunk\\ndisease of 30%, left anterior was proximal 30% and mid 90%\\nleft circumflex was mid 50%.  Ramus intermedius was 90% which\\nwas angioplastied and stented and the right coronary showed\\nan osteal lesion of 30%.  There was concern of right external\\niliac artery dissection.  The patient underwent a right\\nfemoral ultrasound which demonstrated triphasic flow in the\\nright common femoral artery with plaque or flap proximal to\\nthe right SFA with stenosis and did have episodes of SVG and\\nwas begun on beta blockers. Aspirin and Plavix were continued\\npost stenting.  The groin was without bleeding and he had\\ndistal pulses.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the cardiologist, requested that\\nvascular be consulted regarding the findings on the right\\niliac SFA ultrasound.  The patient, although study was\\nabnormal but with intact distal pulses, the patient did note\\n72 hours after catheterization, onset of right calf and ankle\\nfoot pain with ambulation.  The patient underwent a repeat\\nperipheral arterial catheterization which demonstrated\\nabdominal aorta with no significant disease, renal arteries\\nbilaterally were normal, the right lower extremity iliac is\\nwithout critical lesions, the previous noted dissection is\\nnot occlusive but the site is still delineated.  The common\\nfemoral is normal, the SFA and profunda artery are normal,\\nthe popliteals occlude mid vessel and the anterior and tibial\\nwere not well visualized but appear thrombolytically\\noccluded.  There was three vessel runoff to the foot.  The\\ncollaterals provide much of the distal flow.  The patient was\\nTPA'd, begun on Heparin and placed in the VICU.  The patient\\nhad consequences of a right groin hematoma after the second\\nright groin intervention and angiography which required\\npressure occlusion.  The patient underwent on [**11-14**], a\\nthrombectomy of the right tibial peroneal trunk and AT artery\\nwith patch angioplasty of the right popliteal artery.  He\\ntolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the VICU\\nfor continued monitoring and care.  The patient required a\\nunit of packed cells for hematocrit of 25, post transfusion\\nhematocrit was 35.  Total CK was 74.  The patient was placed\\non peri-operative Kefzol and remained in the VICU in stable\\ncondition.  On [**11-15**] the patient had an episode of\\nhematemesis.  An NG was placed with 300 cc of blood\\naspirated.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable.\\nSerial hematocrits were obtained and Plavix and Aspirin were\\nheld.  GI was consulted.  The patient underwent upper\\nendoscopy which demonstrated a few non bleeding localized\\nerosions in the esophagus at the GE junction consistent with\\nNG trauma.  There was bilious fluid in the stomach body and\\nantrum.  There is no active bleeding or coffee ground or\\nbright red blood noted.  There were few superficial non\\nbleeding 2 mm ulcers ranging in size from 2 mm to 5 mm in the\\nstomach.  The duodenum was normal.  Recommendations were to\\ncontinue the Protonix at 40 mg q d, discontinue the NG tube,\\nfollow serial hematocrits.  Please consider the risk/benefits\\nof Aspirin and Plavix.  If Aspirin and Plavix need to be\\ncontinued, then we will put the patient on a higher dose of\\nProtonix.
